// Addition of Variables
// Write a program which does the following

// Declare two integer variables a and b
// Assign the value 23 to a and 20 to b
// Output the sum of a and b to the console
// To sum a and b, you can print a + b, like we did with numbers previously.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
     int a,b;
     
     a=23,b =20;
     
     printf("%d",a+b);
     return 0;
     

    
    
}
